#####Rotation
1. rotate array  
  a. right rotate  
  b. left rotate
  
2. cyclically rotate an array by one
3. search an element in a sorted and rotated array in `O(logn)`
4. in a sorted and rotated array find if there is a pair with a given sum
5. find maximum value of sum (i*arr[i]) with only rotation on given array allowed
6. find the rotation count in rotated sorted array
7. find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array
8. find a rotation with maximum hamming distance 
   - Given an array of n elements, create a new array which is a rotation of given array and hamming distance (# of positions at which corresponding elements are different) between both the array is maximum
#####rearrangement
9. split the array and first part to the end
10. rearrange an array such that arr[i] = i 
    - if i not present display -1 at that place 
11. write a program to reverse an array 
12. rearrange array such that arr[i]>=arr[j] if i is even and arr[i]<=arr[j] if i is odd and j<i
13. rearrange array in alternating positive and negative items with O(1) extra space
14. move all zeros to the end of array
15. minimum swap required to bring all elements less than or equal to k together
16. rearrange an array in order- smallest, largest, 2nd smallest, 2nd largest, ...
17. if next valid number is same as current then double the current value and replace next value with 0 and move all zero to the end
18. reorder an array according to given indexes
19. rearrange positive and negative numbers with constant extra space
20. rearrange an array such that arr[j] becomes i
21. arrange given numbers to form the biggest number 
22. replace every array element by multiplication of previous and next
    - first element with first and second & last element with last and 2nd last
23. segregate even and odd number in the array
#####Order
24. Find the k'th largest element in an array (heap)
25. Find the largest three elements in an array
26. Given an n*n matrix, where row and column are sorted in non-decreasing order. Find the kth smallest element in the given 2D array.
27. mean and median of an unsorted array
28. find median of all elements read so far starting from the first integer till last integer
29. minimum product of k integers in an array of positive integers ( priority queue )
30. k-th largest sum of contiguous subarray within the array of numbers which has negative and positive numbers
31. k pairs maximum/minimum sum combinations from two arrays
32. k maximum sums of  contiguous sub-arrays (find - sum & index)
    - overlapping
    - non-overlapping ( kadane's algo )
         - find out k sub-arrays which have k maximum sums.
33. find k smallest elements in same order using O(1) extra space 
34. k-th smallest absolute difference of two elements in an array 
35. second (k)smallest/largest element of an array 
36. find k numbers with most occurrences in the given array 
37. find the smallest missing number from 0 to m-1 and m>n
38. maximum sum such that no two elements are adjacent
39. maximum and minimum of an array using minimum number of comparison
