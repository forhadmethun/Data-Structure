### Introduction
 1. Introduction
 2. Properties
 3. Types of Binary Tree
 4. Tree Properties & Handshaking Lemma
 5. How many different (un)labeled binary tree can be there with n nodes
 6. Insertion in a Binary Tree
 7. Deletion in a Binary Tree
 8. BFS vs DFS for Binary Tree
 9. Array Implementation of Binary Tree
 10. AVL with duplicate keys
   - avl tree with count with every key
 11. Tree DS Application
 12. MST Application
 13. Check if Continuous tree
  - if root to leaf path, absolute difference between keys of two adjacent is 1 is called continuous tree
 14. Foldable Binary trees
  - if left and right subtree are structure wise mirror image of each other. empty tree is considered as foldable
